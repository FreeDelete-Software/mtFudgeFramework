# mtFudgeFramework
A generic Fudge RPG Framework for MapTool based on the "\[Fate v3\] Fate Generic Campaign Framework" by DrVesuvius on the RPtools forums. This project will include the full macroset from version 0.95 of that Framework in a custom campaign (.cmpgn) file.

## Goals

- Rework existing Fate character sheets into customizable Fudge RPG ones.
- Rework existing inventory system for usable items, weapons, and other gear.
- Add various custom Macro Sets for Fudge RPG.
- Implement a streamlined Action/Resolution combat system based on Fudge RPG rules.
- Provide useful documentation for GMs.
- QoL and customizablity improvements? Modularization? Special Tools?


## Author's note

I am not an expert. I am new to MapTool in every aspect. Any contributions or comments from more experienced MapTool developers, contributors, macro authors, or GMs would be greatly appreciated.
